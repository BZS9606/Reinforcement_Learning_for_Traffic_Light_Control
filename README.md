# DQN_traffic_light_control

## Deep Q Neural Network for single cross-road traffic light
The states transformation principles is shown in the graph:

![States Transformation Graph](https://github.com/quantumiracle/DQN_traffic_light_control/blob/master/states.png)

States representation:

0: Green 1 & Red 2\
1: Red 1 & Green 2\
2: Yellow 1 & Red 2\
3: Red 1 & Yellow 2



Actions representation:

0: change state\
1: keep on
